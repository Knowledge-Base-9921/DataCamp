## Description

Understanding Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is essential for any data scientist, engineer, or leader to take machine learning models from a local notebook to a functioning model in production. This course introduces you to the key processes, phases, and levels of MLOps, including design, development, deployment, and monitoring. You'll discover how automation enables organizations to efficiently launch, monitor, and update their machine learning models.
