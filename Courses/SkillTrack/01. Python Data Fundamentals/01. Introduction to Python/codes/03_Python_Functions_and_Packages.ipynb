    "Out of the box, Python offers a bunch of built-in functions to make your life as a data scientist easier. You already know two such functions: ``print()`` and ``type()``. There are also functions like ``str()``, ``int()``, ``bool()`` and ``float()`` to switch between data types. You can find out about them <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html\">here</a>. These are built-in functions as well.\n",
