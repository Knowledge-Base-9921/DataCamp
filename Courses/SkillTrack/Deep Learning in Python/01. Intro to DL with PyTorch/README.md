## Course Details

| Part | Title | Description | Status |
|------|-------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | Introduction to PyTorch, a Deep Learning Library | Self-driving cars, smartphones, search engines... Deep learning is now everywhere. Before you begin building complex models, you will become familiar with PyTorch, a deep learning framework. You will learn how to manipulate tensors, create PyTorch data structures, and build your first neural network in PyTorch with linear layers. | Completed |
| 2 | Neural Network Architecture and Hyperparameters | To train a neural network in PyTorch, you will first need to understand additional components, such as activation and loss functions. You will then realize that training a network requires minimizing that loss function, which is done by calculating gradients. You will learn how to use these gradients to update your model's parameters. | Completed |
| 3 | Training a Neural Network with PyTorch | Now that you've learned the key components of a neural network, you'll train one using a training loop. You'll explore potential issues like vanishing gradients and learn strategies to address them, such as alternative activation functions and tuning learning rate and momentum. | Completed |
| 4 | Evaluating and Improving Models | Training a deep learning model is an art, and to make sure our model is trained correctly, we need to keep track of certain metrics during training, such as the loss or the accuracy. We will learn how to calculate such metrics and how to reduce overfitting. | Completed |
