## Description

In this course, you'll use PyTorch to discover image classification, object recognition, segmentation, and image generation. You'll work with both binary and multi-class image classification models, utilize pre-trained models for deep learning tasks, and master object detection with bounding boxes. Additionally, you'll delve into image segmentation, including semantic, instance, and panoptic types, with real-world applications. Finally, you'll explore Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and learn to assess the quality and diversity of the generated images.
